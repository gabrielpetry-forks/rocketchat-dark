> Dark Userstyle for Rocket.Chat

## Why?

Because everything needs a dark theme. And because Rocket-Chat has no dark mode yet, except for the iOS app.

## Installation

- Install a Userstyle-Addon like Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne))
- Create a new style and copy the content of [`style.css`](style.css) into it

Make sure to restrict the scope of the style to the domain of your Rocket.Chat installation.

## TODO

This theme is not finished yet. It's usable but the admin interface and other parts will remain light.
